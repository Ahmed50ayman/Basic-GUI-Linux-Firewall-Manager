# Basic-GUI-Linux-Firewall-Manager
 This is a firewall manager written in Python with a GUI that has the ability to give users a interface to block services/ports, IP addresses, and to manage the Firewall. The Firewall manager relies on IPtables and the package ufw. This program has been tested on Parrot OS a Ubuntu Distro and Kali a Debian Distro. This leads me to believe that this software will work on most Debian and Ubuntu Distros.
