# Basic-GUI-Linux-Firewall-Manager

Note all dependencies should be installed with your default Debian or Ubuntu installation if not try the following command "sudo apt-get install python-tk"

# Description
This is a firewall manager written in Python3 with a GUI that has the ability to give users a interface to block services/ports, IP addresses, and to manage the Firewall. The Firewall manager relies on IPtables and the package ufw. This program has been tested on Parrot OS a Ubuntu Distro and Kali a Debian Distro. This leads me to believe that this software will work on most Debian and Ubuntu Distros. This is somewhat of a continuation of my other firewall manager that was written in Bash with only a command line interface. This Python script was coded entirly by hand in a notepad without an IDE.
